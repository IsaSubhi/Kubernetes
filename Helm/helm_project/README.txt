This is my helm project.


The files inside the HTML folder needs to be copied to the NODES folder as in the values.yaml, pv: path: "INSERT_DESIRED_PATH"
The path can be changed to any directory that kubernetes can copy the files from it from the NODES.


This project checks the username and password input, if they are correct it redirects the user to the main HTML webpage.


*USERNAME: user
*PASSWORD: password
